# Bomb Sweeper

## Work in progress (for the Code Institute as second Milestone Project)

## Design choices

#### Class based over Functional ?

Class based project (OOP) seem to be good choice because: - Code is cleaner, functions (methods) are stored in objects. - Provides encapsulation thus better readability. - Strict Mode out of the box - Good exercise

### Pseudocode

1. [] Create Initial Utility Class with features:

- [] selecting element from the DOM for easy manipulation,
- [] toggle of the elements visibility,

2. [] Create Main Menu Class with features:

- [] Load Game depending on set difficulty
  - [x] Used Google Search to find rules of minesweeper for difficulty levels: <br>
        "There are three difficulty levels for Minesweeper: beginner, intermediate, and expert. Beginner has a total of ten mines and the board size is either 8 Ã— 8, 9 Ã— 9, or 10 Ã— 10. Intermediate has 40 mines and also varies in size between 13 Ã— 15 and 16 Ã— 16. Finally, expert has 99 mines and is always 16 Ã— 30 (or 30 Ã— 16)."
- [] Options, where user can change level of difficulty (default set to beginner)
  - [] possible extra feature hardcore mode? with game with some kind of timer, that would set difficulty on another level.
  - [] for hardcore mode change them of the game (more aggressive)

3. [] Game Logic Class

- [] Create game board depending on board size and bomb count set by user.
- [] Left Mouse Click on a board's cell reveals either bomb (that ends the game) or number showing how many bombs are around that cell.
- [] Right Mouse Button on a board's cell marks the user choice/prediction for bomb location
- Win/Lose condition:
  - [] **lose**: when user click on the cell with bomb - reveal all bombs for user to see their locations.
    - [] also show "lose" paragraph on the screen (possible: change game's logo to red? / sound of the bomb?)
  - [] **win** after all bombs are marked correctly and rest of cell's are revealed.
    - [] also show "win" paragraph on the screen (possible: change game's logo to green? / sound for the win condition)
- [] Show how many bombs are to select/guess (count of bombs emojis? ðŸ’£ ðŸ’£ ðŸ’£ | decreasing/increasing depending on the user selection)
- [] New Game Button (reset whole game)

# **rough notes** (early development only!)

## design choices

- used Coolors for color scheme <br>
  temporary pallette: https://coolors.co/2b2d42-f7b32b-edf2f4-6ac8c6-d90429
- Google fonts: main font - Ubuntu

### Main Menu:

- Selecting text changes it to red color to match "exploding" theme.

## development

CSS Reset shared by [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/).
CSS custom properties (variables) to avoid DRY principle.
CSS Desktop first as the game is targeted mostly to PC gamers (that might change).
Used [Dash Border Generator](https://kovart.github.io/dashed-border-generator/) to generate custom styled border for main wrapper.

### **Things to implement/fix:**

- **First click never can be a bomb hit:** <br>
  (description found in this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/djnck/minesweeper_debate_can_you_can_lose_on_the_first/) post.) <br>
  In Windows, the Minesweeper board is generated randomly before the player clicks any squares.[citation needed] If the player happens to click a mine square on their very first click, the mine at this square is removed and a new mine is placed in the upper left corner. If there is already a mine in the upper left corner (or it was the square that the player clicked), a new mine is placed in the first (starting in the upper left corner then proceeding left->right, top->bottom) available empty spot of the board. Once this change is made, the game proceeds as if the initial clicked square was empty. This is done to ensure that the player will not lose on their very first click.
