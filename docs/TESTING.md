## Code Validation

## Lighthouse

I used lighthouse in chrome developer tools to test each of the pages for:

- Performance - how the page performs whilst loading.
- Accessibility - how accessible is the site for all users and how can it be improved.
- Best practices - how does the site conform to industry best practices.
- SEO - search engine optimization. Is the site optimized for search engine result rankings.
